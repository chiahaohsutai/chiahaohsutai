**Welcome!!**

Hi, I’m Chia — a full-stack engineer. Most of the projects here are learning-driven and focused on understanding how software works at a deeper level, so you’ll see projects that involve rebuilding core software from scratch—compilers, servers, and more.

The more I learn, the more I appreciate the craftsmanship behind modern technology. Software isn’t magic; it’s the result of deliberate design and effort from developers who care about building things well.

Happy coding.
